# README

I've given up on using JavaFX for frontend code, so now I'm swotching it over to HTML5, CSS, and JS for frontend code. 
I'm using Java for backend code and connect the frontend to it via Spring Boot. 
MySql will still be where I'm storing my data into the database.

Previous attempts are the repos JeopardyApp and JeopardyProject (now dead projects)

## Github branch workflow
working --> merging --> testing --> main

- working: Where I write new code/ideas
- merging: Where I merge in code from working branch (that works)
- testing: Where I merge in code that should work when deployed
- main: Code that completely works and is ready to be deployed
